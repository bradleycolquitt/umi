Comparison between raw featureCounts and either sum of filtered (bc and umi quality) or binomial MLE of n indicates that raw counts are better than fitlered or inferred expression estimate. 

So will hold off on development of read db for expression quant
However, bam_sql_cy2 will still be potentially useful for quick access to expression levels.

Look into just bc filtering compared to raw counts.
