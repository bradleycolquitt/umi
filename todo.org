** although current algo might be fine

** In database
*** Create BamDB_PE class
**** PE option in load2db creates this class
**** Restructure methods that require SE/PE distinctation as class functions for BamDB and BamDB_PE

** In annotation join
* DONE alter merge so that new database is created for join

** then delete individual reads db
*** takes forever to drop a table in sqlite
* Aggregate reads not working for large files
** TODO determine if this is actually due ot large files (and how large to see effect) or if this is some weird directory issue.

* DESIGN
** featureCounts -R to intersect reads with annotation
** extract BC/UMI of reads in annotation_set
*** create hash table of read_id/annotation
*** hash table of gene, pos, bc, umi 
**** concatenate values
